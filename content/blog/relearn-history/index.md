> America is not unique in its sins as a country. We’re not unique in our evils...I think where we may be singular is our refusal to acknowledge them. And the legends and myths we tell about our inherent, you know, good-ness to hide and cover and conceal so that we can maintain a kind of willful ignorance that protects our innocence.

Lately, I’ve been studying a lot of history. When I was in school, history just felt like memorizing the dates of supposedly “important” events and the names of dead people; I couldn’t fathom how it could be applicable for my life.

But now, I understand that our interpretation of history is perhaps the single greatest thing that influences our lens on the present: why things are the way they are, what is unjust and what is deserved, what kind of contribution we want to make to the world around us before we go. So I’ve taken it upon myself to invest in a bit of re-education: These Truths for a new perspective on U.S. history; From The Ruins of Empire to better understand Asia’s perspective; Roman Empire history; Indigenous American history; and more.

One of the most helpful practices I’ve developed in my self-education is asking questions. And especially recently, I’ve had a lot of questions about the plight of Black people in America. 

### Why is police brutality towards Black Americans normalized and unprosecuted? Why are they more likely to be sent to the frontlines in a crippling pandemic, yet are least likely to have the support of healthcare infrastructure to match this burden? Why does the Black community consistently rank lower than others home ownership measures; wealth accumulation, education levels, and health?

Given our painful two-hundred-year legacy of enslavement, some may feel that our current situation, while painful, was inevitable. Any reasonable nineteenth-century spectator would’ve predicted the ascent from slavery to true equality to be a long, laborious process, right? Maybe enacting significant change within long-standing political and societal structures was always going to be challenging, not unlike agonizingly thrusting a boulder up a large hill; starting and stopping, sometimes taking a step back, ever in aspiration of a glimpse over the horizon.

But the inconvenient truth is that it didn’t need to be this way. Other countries have wrestled with painful legacies yet have emerged in a much different place than us today.

Today, class, we’re going to learn about...dun dun dun...**Germany**! 🇩🇪

I’m not the first to suggest that America could take a pointer on moving past racism from Germany’s wrangling with Nazism. But stick around...my essay comes with _photos._

## Onto the good stuff: a bunch of important events and some names of dead people

At first, post-World-War-Two Germany and post-Civil-War America seemed to chart very similar courses. Both initially prioritized amnesty and integration. 

Neither country aggressively prosecuted leaders of the deposed groups. Although much has been made of the Nurmeburg trials, only twenty-five of the top Nazi officials were put on trial. After the Civil War, no Confederate leaders were prosecuted.

Both countries reinstated Nazi/Confederate leaders into positions of power. 

#### The nefarious consequence of these practices became a lack of acknowledgement of the actions and beliefs that had led to war in the first place. 

“In Germany, the Nuremburg trials were dismissed as ‘Siegerjustiz’: mere revenge taken by the victors upon the vanquished...The prevailing German view became that Nazi crimes were the fault of just a tiny clique of evil individual leaders, and that the vast majority of Germans were innocent,” Jared Diamond explains in Upheaval. 

In America, a narrative unfolded that the Civil War hadn’t been fought over slavery; it was about states’ rights. Instead of a nationwide self-apprisal over our perpetuation of a monstrous human rights violation, Southern states were allowed to reinstate slavery in everything but name through unpaid indentured servitute, or sharecropping. 

## But then, two roads diverged...

Germany was ambling down a path that may have led it to as distraught a position as America is in today. But soon, their route forked.


German Jewish lawyer Fritz Bauer pushed his country down that alternate road. Pushing back against significant institutional inertia, verbal attacks, and even death threats, he prosecuted ordinary Germans--not just high-profile leaders--in Germany in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Unlike the Nuremberg trials, he went after minor officials: doctors, judges, low-level guards and police, and foot soldiers.

“In reality, many, perhaps most, of Bauer’s prosecutions failed,” Diamond continues. ”Instead, the significance of Bauer’s work was that he, a German, in German courts, demonstrated to the German public again and again, in excruciating detail, the beliefs and deeds of Germans during the Nazi era. Nazi misdeeds were not just the work of a few bad leaders. Instead, masses of ordinary German soldiers and officials...had carried out Nazi orders, and had therefore been guilty of crimes against humanity.”

This reckoning changed the course of German history. They confronted the painful reality of their past sins. 

Americans, well...didn’t.

### According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful

The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.

When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rhetoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole
and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects
again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using
her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts.

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a
large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in
which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an
almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox
advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild
Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen.
